I've been meaning to start a blog for a long time, and finally decided to actually do it. I'm not really sure how it will turn out (in terms of content), I don't want to necessarily keep it strictly about tech. I am hoping this post will contribute somewhat to setting the scene for the future of it. The initial idea is to write a weekly post, whatever subject that may be.

Some topics of interest that I would like to share include (but aren't limited to):
- Software Development
- Music
- Photography
- Movies
- Books

I hope that some of it can be of use, beyond me having a place to dump my thoughts :-)

Feel free to get in touch via email or twitter.
