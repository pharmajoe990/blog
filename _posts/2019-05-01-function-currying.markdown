### Update

_So I have decided to migrate some of the notes I have made into this blog, so they don't get buried or lost. Maybe I'll publish this to the Web at some point._

## Functional Programming?

As I'm sure most developers are aware, everyone seems to be talking about Functional Programming. I have to admit, a lot of the Computer Science parts are lost on me, which AFAIK seem to make up a lot of the justification for applying these techniques. In my day to day work I tend to use some of the techniques I've learned, and I thought it would be good to brain dump.

## What is currying?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) can explain better than I can. Suffice to say it doesn't involve Keen's Curry Powder.
