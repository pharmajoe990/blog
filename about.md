I am a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. I live in a town an hour's drive south-west of Melbourne known as Geelong.

This part of the world is truly magic - pristine beaches and a great climate. It can tend to get extremely hot in the summer, in excess of 40Â°C at times. Most of the year it is comfortable and it doesn't get cold enough for snow in winter, although it can be miserable and wet. The most unique aspect of the weather here is how changable it is, we can literally experience 4 seasons in a day with rain, sun and wind at hourly intervals.

I have worked in the IT industry for almost all of my adult life, as a technician in a small computer shop and as a Software Engineer and Developer for various companies, also as a consultant for a short while. I have always been interested in computers, electronics & tech. My father was an Analog Electrical Engineer and exposed me to computers at a young age, I remember playing with an original Macintosh at his workplace when I was 5 or so years old.

My specific areas of interest within the industry are:
- Web Development
- Open source software
- Languages including Ruby, Javascript, Java, Scala 
- Functional programming
- Linux
- Apple Hardware
